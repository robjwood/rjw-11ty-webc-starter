# Basic starter site

Basic starter site (based off 11ty Sass Skeleton created by by [@5t3ph](https://twitter.com/5t3ph)).

It includes an 'Elements' page with a list of HTML elements to show how the styles are applied. This is not an exhaustive list of elements.

There's also a 'Components' page, which may be a misleading. They're really examples of a few common patterns that with their own component styling.

I've stripped the styles down but left references to more opinionated styles commented out of `main.scss`.

Update the info in `_data/meta.js` to suit your needs. 

Instructions below from the original 11ty Sass Skeleton README ðŸ‘‡.

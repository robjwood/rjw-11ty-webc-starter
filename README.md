# Basic starter site

Basic starter site using [Webc](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/languages/webc/) for components. This is based off the [11ty Sass Skeleton](https://github.com/5t3ph/11ty-sass-skeleton) created by [@5t3ph](https://twitter.com/5t3ph) with a big dollop of [11ty.webc.fun](https://github.com/darthmall/11ty.webc.fun) by [darthmall](https://darthmall.net/).

It includes an 'Elements' page with a list of HTML elements to show how the styles are applied. This is not an exhaustive list of elements.

There's also a 'Components' page, with a few (very) basic Webc components.

I've stripped the styles down but left references to more opinionated styles commented out of `main.scss`.

Update the info in `data/meta.js` to suit your needs.
